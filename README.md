NASA L'Space Mission Concept Academy Summer 2023

The Mission Concept Academy (MCA) focuses on professionalizing students to work on a space mission provided by the Academy leadership team.  Each week students engage in an interactive session that connects them with STEM professionals working in the space ecosystem helping to make what is being learned in their school coursework real and relevant.  Throughout the program, students work on an interdisciplinary team as they collaborate and grapple with the challenge of designing a lander to further the science related to the semester's mission and are expected to develop and present a comprehensive Preliminary Design Review (PDR) document.
